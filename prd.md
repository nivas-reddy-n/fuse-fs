# PRD: FUSE Virtual File System

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: FUSE Virtual File System
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary
The FUSE Virtual File System is a custom file system implementation using Filesystem in User space (FUSE) that enhances storage efficiency, security, and performance without requiring kernel-level modifications. 

This system incorporates metadata-based storage with MySQL for efficient file management, cloud integration with Google Drive for remote file syncing, and implements LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching to reduce disk I/O and improve read speeds. The implementation will use Python with fusepy, MySQL, and the Google Drive API.

## 6. Narrative
Alex is a data scientist who needs to work with large datasets while ensuring they're backed up securely. He wants reliable file access with good performance because his analyses are time-sensitive. He finds the FUSE Virtual File System and discovers it offers the perfect combination of local performance (through LFU caching) and security (through Google Drive backup). The filesystem's metadata capabilities also allow him to organize and find his data more efficiently than with a traditional filesystem.
